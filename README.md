# GTD on RemNote

## a plugin to make it smoother to use GTD on RN.


### Introduction

This chapter supposes you have know the workflow of GTD. 
- If you don't, there are lots of tutorials in YouTube or BiliBili.

After Setting up the plugin, a rem named `GTD Container Panel` is shown in the sidebar.

Expand the "DRAFT"  you can find that there are 2 documents created: `Host` and `GTD Container Panel` 
- `GTD Container Panel` is unique but duplicated here for one is shown as Draft, another is shown directly by a portal in the sidebar

The `Host` looks like this:

These properties are corresponding to the GTD workflow.

### Configurations on properties of the hosts

For limited API, you needed to configure some properties of `Host` manually at your first usage.

Properties need to be configured are shown below with their configuration accordingly.
- after setting up the type and source type of the two properties `TIME_TYPE` and `TREAT_AS`, options to these properties should be loaded automatically.

If you have already set some rem with similar functions, you can change the name of these properties to that same with those legacy rem  and merge them by click the "merge" button in the right.
and the name of `Host` and `GTD Container Panel` is also editable. 

### Usage

After determining the date, owner GTD item and scenario of a GTD item( or leaving them in blank), you can choose the options in "TREAT_AS" property.
The GTD item will be processed automatically and moved to corresponding Container in the `GTD Container Panel` and/or Daily Document if its property `THE_DATE` is specified.
